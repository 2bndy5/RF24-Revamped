.. |get_start_desc| replace:: A simple example of sending data from 1 nRF24L01 transceiver to another.
.. |ac_pl_desc| replace:: A simple example of sending data from 1 nRF24L01 transceiver to another with Acknowledgement (ACK) payloads attached to ACK packets.
.. |manack_desc| replace:: This is a simple example of using the RF24 class on a Raspberry Pi to transmit and respond with acknowledgment (ACK) transmissions. Notice that the auto-ack feature is enabled, but this example doesn't use automatic ACK payloads because automatic ACK payloads' data will always be outdated by 1 transmission. Instead, this example uses a call and response paradigm.
.. |multiceiver_desc| replace:: A simple example of sending data from as many as 6 nRF24L01 transceivers to 1 receiving transceiver. This technique is trademarked by Nordic Semiconductors as "MultiCeiver".
.. |streaming_desc| replace:: This is a simple example of using the RF24 class on a Raspberry Pi for streaming multiple payloads.
.. |interrupt_desc| replace:: This is a simple example of using the RF24 class on a Raspberry Pi to detecting (and verifying) the IRQ (interrupt) pin on the nRF24L01.
.. |scanner_desc| replace:: This example is best used as a diagnostic tool to determine what RF channels have less interference in your vicinity.
.. |use_serial_mon| replace:: Use the Serial Monitor to change each node's behavior.
.. |2_or_more_devs| replace:: This example was written to be used on 2 devices acting as "nodes".
