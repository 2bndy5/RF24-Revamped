RF24 Revamped is a simplified and extensible API for TMRh20's popular
Optimized High Speed Driver for nRF24L01(+) 2.4GHz Wireless Transceiver

Goals Design Goals
------------------

This library fork is still designed to be...

* More compliant with the manufacturer specified operation of the chip, while allowing
  advanced users to work outside the recommended operation.
* Utilize the capabilities of the radio to their full potential via multiple platforms
  (i.e. Arduino & Raspberry Pi)
* More reliable, responsive, bug-free and feature rich
* Easy for beginners to use, with well documented examples and features
* Consumed with a public interface that's similar to other Arduino standard libraries

Change Log
----------

See `the releases <http://github.com/2bndy5/RF24/releases>`_ for a details on what was
changed in each version of the library
